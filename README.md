# League of Legends S13 - Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of League of Legends Season 13 data. The analysis includes various visualizations created using Plotly Express.

## Why Are Some Images Not Showing Up?

The visualizations created using Plotly Express are interactive plots. GitHub's notebook viewer does not support rendering these interactive plots directly, so they won't show up here.

## How to View the Interactive Plots

To view the interactive Plotly plots, you need to download the repository and open the notebook in a local Jupyter environment. Follow these simple steps:

### Steps to View the Notebook Locally

1. **Download the Repository**

   Click on the green "Code" button at the top of this page, then click "Download ZIP". Unzip the downloaded file to your computer.

2. **Open the Notebook in Jupyter**

   You need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. If you don't have it, [install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section) which includes Jupyter Notebook.

3. **Navigate to the Downloaded Folder**

   Open Anaconda Navigator, launch Jupyter Notebook, and navigate to the folder where you unzipped the downloaded file.

4. **Open `League_of_Analysis.ipynb`**

   In Jupyter Notebook, click on `League_of_Analysis.ipynb` to open it. You will now be able to see and interact with the Plotly visualizations.
